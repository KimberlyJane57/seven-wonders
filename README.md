# seven-wonders

## Description
Aerial view of each wonder using the Google Maps API and a list of location details including hotels, restaurants and attractions near it using the TripAdvisor API. 
Our motivation for this app is to get people interested in learning about the new 7 Wonders for 2023 and inspire them to go visit these beautiful locations. 
As an uninspired traveler, I want to be able to research and view new places of interest for upcoming travel.
