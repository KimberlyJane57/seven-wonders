          <p class="is-size-5">
            1,000 years ago, in 1023, work began building this astonishing
            Gothic-style Benedictine abbey, known throughout the medieval world
            as the ‘Wonder of the West’.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            Perito Moreno is considered by many to be the most beautiful glacier
            on Earth. Located in Los Glaciares National Park, in the far
            southern reaches of Patagonia, this vast wall of jagged turquoise
            ice covers more than 100 square miles and reaches almost 200 feet
            high.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            The UNESCO World Heritage site of Hegra is famous for its elaborate
            monumental tombs carved into stark red sandstone cliffs; AlUla Old
            Town is a labyrinth of now abandoned mud brick houses strewn with
            the earthy hues of the desert. There’s ancient rock art and
            restaurants from to-name chefs – including Maraya, set up by
            Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton, and located on top of the
            largest mirrored building in the world.

            The end of 2022 saw the completion of the long-awaited Trans Bhutan
            Trail, a 250-mile long-distance trekking route that crosses the
            country from Haa in the west to Trashigang in the east. Passing
            through 27 local villages, dozens of temples, and 12 mountain passes
            it is, perhaps, the ultimate way to see one of the last great
            Himalayan kingdoms.

            2023 marks 100 years since the end of the Ottoman Empire, and the
            beginning of modern Turkey. Sitting at the crossroads of Europe and
            Asia, Turkey is rich with awe-inspiring culture and heritage. But
            it’s also home to one of the world’s great natural wonders:
            Cappadocia.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            Spanning 190 miles across Northern England from St Bees on the Irish
            Sea to Robin Hood Bay on the North Sea, it has grown to become the
            most popular long-distance hike in the country. There are many
            highlights, but undoubtedly the most beautiful part of all is the
            section which crosses the Lake District.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            The Sardine Run is one of the ocean’s most remarkable events. Every
            year from May through July, tens of millions of sardines migrate
            along South Africa’s Wild Coast. It is estimated that, in terms of
            biomass, it rivals even the great wildebeest migration in Africa.
            Shoals can reach up to nine miles long. The activity in the water is
            so intense it can be witnessed from an airplane.
