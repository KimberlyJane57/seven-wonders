            1,000 years ago, in 1023, work began building this astonishing
            Gothic-style Benedictine abbey, known throughout the medieval world
            as the ‘Wonder of the West’.

            Perito Moreno is considered by many to be the most beautiful glacier on Earth. Located in Los Glaciares National Park, in the far southern reaches of Patagonia, this vast wall of jagged turquoise ice covers more than 100 square miles and reaches almost 200 feet high.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            The UNESCO World Heritage site of Hegra is famous for its elaborate monumental tombs carved into stark red sandstone cliffs; AlUla Old Town is a labyrinth of now abandoned mud brick houses strewn with the earthy hues of the desert. There’s ancient rock art and restaurants from to-name chefs – including Maraya, set up by Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton, and located on top of the largest mirrored building in the world.

            The end of 2022 saw the completion of the long-awaited Trans Bhutan Trail, a 250-mile long-distance trekking route that crosses the country from Haa in the west to Trashigang in the east. Passing through 27 local villages, dozens of temples, and 12 mountain passes it is, perhaps, the ultimate way to see one of the last great Himalayan kingdoms.

            2023 marks 100 years since the end of the Ottoman Empire, and the beginning of modern Turkey. Sitting at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Turkey is rich with awe-inspiring culture and heritage. But it’s also home to one of the world’s great natural wonders: Cappadocia.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            Spanning 190 miles across Northern England from St Bees on the Irish Sea to Robin Hood Bay on the North Sea, it has grown to become the most popular long-distance hike in the country. There are many highlights, but undoubtedly the most beautiful part of all is the section which crosses the Lake District.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            The Sardine Run is one of the ocean’s most remarkable events. Every year from May through July, tens of millions of sardines migrate along South Africa’s Wild Coast. It is estimated that, in terms of biomass, it rivals even the great wildebeest migration in Africa. Shoals can reach up to nine miles long. The activity in the water is so intense it can be witnessed from an airplane.
